# GPU Performance Analysis - L40S Training Runs

## Summary
Based on the analysis of your recent training runs, here's what I found about your L40S GPU performance:

## Key Performance Metrics from Job 1354430 (Most Recent)

### Training Performance
- **Training Speed**: ~7.3 steps/second during training
- **Evaluation Speed**: ~120 samples/second during evaluation
- **Total Training Time**: 688 seconds (~11.5 minutes) for 5 epochs
- **Batch Size**: 128
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001

### Hardware Configuration
- **Node**: watgpu608 
- **GPU**: L40S (based on your description)
- **CPUs**: 16 cores
- **Memory**: 32GB allocated
- **Time Limit**: 10 hours (actual usage: ~11.5 minutes)

## Performance Assessment

### Good Indicators
1. **Stable Training**: Consistent training speed of ~7.3 steps/second throughout
2. **Fast Evaluation**: 120+ samples/second during evaluation phases
3. **Successful Completion**: Training completed without memory errors or crashes
4. **Model Checkpointing**: Successfully saved multiple checkpoints during training
5. **Reasonable Loss Progression**: Loss decreased from ~0.8 to ~0.82 (though modest improvement)

### Potential Areas for GPU Optimization

1. **Batch Size**: Currently using 128, which might not fully utilize L40S's 48GB memory
2. **No Explicit GPU Monitoring**: Previous runs lacked GPU utilization tracking
3. **Mixed Precision**: No indication of using mixed precision training (FP16/BF16)

## L40S GPU Baseline Expectations

The L40S is a high-end GPU with:
- **Memory**: 48GB GDDR6
- **Compute**: Ada Lovelace architecture
- **Tensor Cores**: 4th gen for ML acceleration
- **Expected Performance**: Should handle much larger batch sizes and models

## Recommendations for Better GPU Utilization

### 1. Increase Batch Size
Try increasing batch size to better utilize the 48GB memory:
```bash
# In your training config, try:
batch_size = 256 or 512 (depending on model size)
```

### 2. Enable Mixed Precision Training
Add to your training configuration:
```python
# Use automatic mixed precision (AMP)
from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler
```

### 3. Monitor GPU Utilization
The updated SLURM script now includes:
- Real-time GPU monitoring with `nvidia-smi dmon`
- Periodic utilization logging every 30 seconds
- GPU state capture at start and end

### 4. Gradient Accumulation
If memory allows, consider gradient accumulation for effective larger batch sizes:
```python
gradient_accumulation_steps = 4  # Effective batch size = 128 * 4 = 512
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Updated Script**: The new `ttm_finetune.sh` will provide detailed GPU metrics
2. **Run a Baseline**: Execute one training run to establish current GPU utilization baseline
3. **Iterative Optimization**: Gradually increase batch size until you reach ~80-90% GPU memory usage
4. **Compare Results**: Use the new monitoring to compare before/after optimization

## File Organization Improvements

âœ… **Completed**:
- SLURM logs now organized in `results/runs/slurm_logs/`
- Each run gets timestamped directory in `results/runs/ttm_finetune/`
- GPU monitoring and utilization logging added
- Run metadata captured in `run_info.txt`
- Training logs saved to `training.log`
- GPU metrics saved to `gpu_monitoring.log` and `gpu_utilization.log`

## Expected Performance Improvement

With proper optimization, you should expect:
- **2-4x higher batch sizes** (256-512 vs current 128)
- **Better GPU utilization** (target: 80-90% vs unknown current)
- **Potentially faster convergence** due to larger effective batch sizes
- **Better monitoring** to identify bottlenecks

The L40S is a powerful GPU, and based on your current stable training, there's likely significant room for performance improvement through better utilization of its 48GB memory capacity.
