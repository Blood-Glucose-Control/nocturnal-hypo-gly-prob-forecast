# Setting up the Aleppo Dataset

1. Download the dataset from [Aleppo (2017)](https://github.com/IrinaStatsLab/Awesome-CGM/wiki/Aleppo-(2017))
2. Change dataset directory in `preprocess.py` and run it (any line commented with a `TODO:` must be modified)
3. The second step will create a csv file. Pass this file path into `AleppoDataLoader` class
