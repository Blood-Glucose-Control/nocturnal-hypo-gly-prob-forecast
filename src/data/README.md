# Data Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the data sources and standardized format used in our benchmark pipeline for nocturnal hypoglycemia prediction.

## Historical Context
Our benchmark pipeline was originally built on the Kaggle Bristol Type 1 Diabetes Dataset, which has influenced some of our naming conventions and data structures. This historical context helps explain certain design decisions:

- **Column naming convention**: The `-0:00` suffix in column names (e.g., `bg-0:00`) indicates current time measurements. While we could use `+1:00` for future measurements, this is not currently utilized in our pipeline. We are trying ot remove this so it technically shouldn't exist anymore.
- **Time intervals**: The Kaggle dataset combines data from different types of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs):
  - Dexcom users: 5-minute intervals
  - Libre users: 15-minute intervals
- **Time column**: The `time` column was originally used to distinguish between these different interval types in the Kaggle dataset.

- **WIP**: We are removing all `-0:00` suffixes to avoid confusion. **THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE.**

## Supported Datasets

   - WIP...

## Data Format Standardization

All datasets are transformed into a standardized format for our benchmark pipeline. The following sections detail the required columns and dataset-specific features.

### Core Columns (Required for All Datasets)

The DataFrame index should `datetime`.

| Column | Type | Description | Source |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `datetime` | `pd.Timestamp` **INDEX** | Primary timestamp for each measurement | Mapped from `time` or original `datetime` |
| `p_num` | `str` | Patient identifier (e.g., "p01", "glu001") | Artificially created by dataset loader |
| `bg_mM` | `float` | Blood glucose measurement in mmol/L | Original data source, converted from mg/dL if needed |
| `dose_units` | `float` | Insulin dose in units | Original data source |
| `food_g` | `float` | Carbohydrate intake in grams | Original data source |
| `msg_type` | `str` | Message type indicator ('ANNOUNCE_MEAL' or empty) | Derived from rows where `food_g` is not null |
| `cob` | `float` | Carbohydrates on board in grams | Derived from `food_g` using physiological model |
| `carb_availability` | `float` | Estimated total carbohydrates in blood | Derived from `food_g` using physiological model |
| `iob` | `float` | Insulin on board in units | Derived from `dose_units` using physiological model |
| `insulin_availability` | `float` | Insulin in plasma | Derived from `dose_units` using physiological model |

### Optional Activity Metrics
These columns are also available but not used as much due to limited data availability:

| Column | Type | Description | Source |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| `cals` | `float` | Total calories burnt in last 5 minutes | Mapped from `cals-0:00` |
| `steps` | `float` | Number of steps taken | Original data source |
| `hr_bpm` | `float` | Heart rate in beats per minute | Original data source |
| `activity` | `float` | Activity level | Original data source |

## Message Types (Gluroo Dataset)
The dataset includes three types of messages that are processed during data transformation:

1. `DOSE_INSULIN` - Records insulin administration events
2. `ANNOUNCE_MEAL` - Captures meal announcements and carbohydrate intake
3. `INTERVENTION_SNACK` - Tracks snack interventions (TODO: Add this to the `clean_dataset`)

### Dataset-Specific Features

#### Kaggle Dataset
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `time` | `pd.Timestamp` | Time of day (HH:MM:SS format) used to determine patient CGM interval type, converted to `datetime` index |

#### Gluroo Dataset
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `food_protein` | `float` | Protein content in grams |
| `trend` | `str` | Glucose trend (e.g., "rising", "falling") from Dexcom/Libre |
| `food_g` | `float` | Food grams (standardized carbohydrate column) |
| `food_g_keep` | `float` | Original meal carbohydrate values (for tracking only) |
| `affects_fob` | `bool` | Food on board flag |
| `affects_iob` | `bool` | Insulin on board flag |
| `day_start_shift` | `int` | Day start definition for data processing |

## Dataset Standardization Process

To add a new dataset to the pipeline, follow these steps:

A good example: `src\data\diabetes_datasets\kaggle_bris_t1d\bris_t1d.py`

### 1. Fetch Raw Data
- If the data source can be fetched from Kaggle or Hugging Face, use `cache_manager` to fetch the raw data
- If the data cannot be fetched via API, make sure documentation is included to inform users where to download and place the data in the repository
- Check out `cache-system.md` for more details

All data should be placed in the `cache` directory:
```
cache/data/
├── ${dataset_name}/
│   ├── processed/
│   │   └── patient_1.csv
│   └── raw/
│       └── patient_1.csv
```

### 2. Implementation Steps

**High-level overview:**
1. Create a data loader
2. Load raw data from cache
3. Process raw data
4. Save and return processed data

#### 2.1 Create Data Loader
- Create a new directory: `src/data/datasets/${dataset_name}/`
- Create a new file: `src/data/datasets/${dataset_name}/${dataset_name}_dataset.py`
- Inherit from `DatasetBase` class
- Implement required abstract methods
- Add caching mechanism to avoid reprocessing raw data (check out `cache-system.md`)

```python
from src.data.diabetes_datasets.dataset_base import DatasetBase

class ${DatasetName}Dataset(DatasetBase):
    def __init__(self, cache=True):
        super().__init__()
        self.cache = cache

    @property
    def dataset_name(self):
        return "${dataset_name}"

    def load_raw(self):
        # Implementation for loading raw data
        return raw_df

    def _process_raw_data(self):
        # Process raw data into standardized format
        # Return processed dataframe

    def _translate_raw_data(self):
        # Convert columns name and units

    def load_data(self):
        if self.raw_data is None:
            self.raw_data = self.load_raw()
        return self._process_raw_data()
```

#### General Flow
**Data Processing Pipeline:**
Raw data → Dataset-specific translation (renaming, unit conversion) → Data processing pipeline (`preprocessing_pipeline`) → Store processed data → Load processed data → Training pipeline → Evaluation stage

For local development, we stick with the default parameters for this data cleaning pipeline so everyone can have uniform cached processed data. For training development, we may want to store different sets of processed data to train and compare performance differences.

#### 2.2 Data Cleaning and Transformation
Implement a data cleaner that performs the following steps in order:

1. **Column Standardization**
   - Rename the dataset's blood glucose level column to `bg_mM` and convert to mmol/L
   - Convert the `time` column to `datetime` and set it as the index (if there is no time column, artificially create one starting from a random date)
   - Convert "food" rows to `food_g` and set `msg_type` to `ANNOUNCE_MEAL`
   - Convert "insulin" column to `dose_units`. Note that this column can contain small consecutive numbers for pump patients or discrete large numbers for non-pump patients
   - Add `p_num`. If your dataset has multiple patients, give each a unique ID like "p01", "p02"
   - The above columns are required
   - Add `cals`, `steps`, `hr_bpm`, and `activity` if they exist
   - Ensure the `datetime` column exists and is set as the DataFrame index

2. **Cleaning Pipeline**
   - Call `preprocessing_pipeline`
   - This will clean up the data and add extra features like IOB and COB from the columns you just converted

### 3. Register the Dataset
- Update `src/data/datasets/__init__.py` to include your new dataset
- Ensure the dataset can be loaded using the standard interface
- See our documentation for examples of why we register our datasets

### 4. Documentation
Document all the changes

### 5. Reference Implementation
See existing implementations in `src/data/datasets/gluroo` and `src/data/datasets/kaggle_bris_t1d` for working examples.

## Future Improvements
- Add `INTERVENTION_SNACK` message type to `preprocessing_pipeline`. We could use a threshold like < 10g = `INTERVENTION_SNACK`, >= 10g = `ANNOUNCE_MEAL`
- Double-check that all `-0:00` suffixes are removed
- Standardize time interval handling across all datasets
- Implement automated data validation checks (should be completed)
- Add data quality metrics reporting
- Create dataset-specific documentation templates
