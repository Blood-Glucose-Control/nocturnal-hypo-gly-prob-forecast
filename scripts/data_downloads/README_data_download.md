# Data Download Scripts

## kaggle_brisT1D

Before following the steps below make sure your machine is configured to work with the kaggle public API:

[How to Use Kaggle - Public API](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api)

To run the script from your main directory, use the following command:

```bash scripts/data_downloads/kaggle_data_download.sh```

Make sure you are in your main directory when you run this command. If the script is executable, you can also run it directly:

1. Make the script executable (if not already done):

```chmod +x scripts/data_downloads/kaggle_data_download.sh```

2. Run the script:

```./scripts/data_downloads/kaggle_data_download.sh```

You need to also make sure to have your local set-up with the kaggle API.
